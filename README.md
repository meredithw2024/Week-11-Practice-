webpage about me

Hi my name is William Meredith I'm 18 years old and I'm a collin college freshmen with a major in Photography. 

My favorite things to do is to sleep, make YouTube videos, take photos, make tik toks, and dance. 

I plan on transfering to the university of north texas in a few years after I complete my basic college classes. 

My favorite genre of music is Pop

What I like about College is that it's mostly self pased and the professors aren't getting on to you like back in high school.
